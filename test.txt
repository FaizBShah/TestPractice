This contains few questions for practise:
Question 1:
A doubly linked list is declared as

struct Node {

       int Value;

       struct Node *Fwd;

       struct Node *Bwd;

);

Where Fwd and Bwd represent forward and backward link to the adjacent elements of the list. Which of the following segments of code deletes the node pointed to by X from the doubly linked list, if it is assumed that X points to neither the first nor the last node of the list?

A. X->Bwd->Fwd = X->Fwd; X->Fwd->Bwd = X->Bwd ;

B. X->Bwd.Fwd = X->Fwd ; X.Fwd->Bwd = X->Bwd ;

C. X.Bwd->Fwd = X.Bwd ; X->Fwd.Bwd = X.Bwd ;

D. X->Bwd->Fwd = X->Bwd ; X->Fwd->Bwd = X->Fwd
