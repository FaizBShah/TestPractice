This contains few questions for practice:
Question 1:
A doubly linked list is declared as

struct Node {

       int Value;

       struct Node *Fwd;

       struct Node *Bwd;

);

Where Fwd and Bwd represent forward and backward link to the adjacent elements of the list. Which of the following segments of code deletes the node pointed to by X from the doubly linked list, if it is assumed that X points to neither the first nor the last node of the list?

A. X->Bwd->Fwd = X->Fwd; X->Fwd->Bwd = X->Bwd ;

B. X->Bwd.Fwd = X->Fwd ; X.Fwd->Bwd = X->Bwd ;

C. X.Bwd->Fwd = X.Bwd ; X->Fwd.Bwd = X.Bwd ;

D. X->Bwd->Fwd = X->Bwd ; X->Fwd->Bwd = X->Fwd

Question 2:
Consider an implementation of unsorted single linked list. Suppose it has its representation with a head and a tail pointer (i.e. pointers to the first and last nodes of the linked list). Given the representation, which of the following operation can not be implemented in O(1) time ?

A. Insertion at the front of the linked list.

B. Insertion at the end of the linked list.

C. Deletion of the front node of the linked list.

D. Deletion of the last node of the linked list.

Question 3:
The minimum number of fields with each node of doubly linked list is

A. 1

B. 2

C. 3

D. 4

Question 4:
Consider a single linked list where F and L are pointers to the first and last elements respectively of the linked list. The time for performing which of the given operations depends on the length of the linked list? 

A. Delete the first element of the list

B. Interchange the first two elements of the list

C. Delete the last element of the list

D. Add an element at the end of the list

Question 5:
The following steps in a linked list

p = getnode()

 info (p) = 10

 next (p) = list

 list = p

result in which type of operation?

A. pop operation in stack

B. removal of a node

C. inserting a node

D. modifying an existing node

a) Domain

b) Relation

c) Set

d) Schema


Question 9:

a) Instance, Schema

b) Relation, Schema

c) Relation, Domain

d) Schema, Instance

Question 10:
